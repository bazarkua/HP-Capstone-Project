# HP Capstone Project 2022
# Objectives

Initially:

* Break down the project into a roadmap and intermediate milestones.
* Develop familiarity with the problem domain by characterizing concisely a broad set of expert knowledge extracted from white papers, training materials, guides, and true human experts.
* Understand the existing codebase, for which there are code walkthrough videos and other documentation.
* Investigate technical approaches and available open source tools. Do experiments to gain familiarity.
* Outline a technical path forward, backed by developed and demonstrated expertise.
* Assemble the necessary development and deployment environments, which includes a cloud-based deployment using Docker and multiple containers.
With the fundamentals in place, development will be iterative and in collaboration with HP technical and product experts.

To do:

* Improve the capability in collaboration with experts who will test and provide feedback based on real- world projects and production runs.
* Provide increased range of input use cases to receive the job request
* Provide improved input data analysis, looking inside the PDF to extract important characteristics of the content be printed, or retrieving technical characteristics of specified paper(s)
* Provide better recommendations and explanations using automated rule-based reasoning, that converts inputs into outputs in one or more steps.
* Provide more robust testing and performance optimization, etc.
* Output results that show the recommended settings along with a textual explanation
* Gather evaluation feedback, that captures responses from experts, both based on expert knowledge and actual production results, and is used to improve the system.
* In all areas, apply a thoughtful technical architecture and implementation.
